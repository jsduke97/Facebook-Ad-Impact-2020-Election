Created as a part of MGT 6203 - Data Analysis for Business for the Georgia Tech OMSA Fall 2022 semester.

SUMMARY:

Based on our analysis and experiments conducted above, we can say ad spending does have a positive impact on and correlates to a larger voter turnout answering our primary research question. Based on the first model, we can see that Trump’s ads seemed more effective than Biden’s ads at bringing out the vote for the 2020 election, apart from the West region which seemed to be more influenced Biden’s ads. Based on the second model, we can say that a 1% increase in ad spend leads to a 420 increase in voter turnout. 
As far as regions, we can see that New England, Midwest and South had a decrease in voter turnout as ad spend increased but the Southwest region was positively impacted. These are the only regions we can speak to as far as impact as they were the only ones that were statistically significant. 
When it comes to demographics, we couldn’t gleam as much in terms of insights as the variables were not statistically significant with and without transformations. When it came to age, the age group of 45-64 was the only demographic segment we can say was impacted by ad spend and they were impacted negatively as a 1% increase in combined ad spend translates to a 464 decrease in voter turnout from 2016 to 2020 for ages 45-64. For gender, the categorical variable was not significant, and this means that although the female voter turnout average is 93,920 and the male voter turnout is higher in comparison, this does not explain the variation in voter turnout.
